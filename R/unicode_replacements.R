# Specify ASCII replacements for specific Unicode characters or sequences of
# Unicode characters. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but does
# include all the Unicode characters so far encountered in Licor data files. It
# also includes other characters that should not be allowed in column names or
# values, such as tabs.
#
# Important note about this code: the order of these replacements matters.
# For example, the replacement for `<c2><b2>` must occur after the replaement
# for `<e2><81><bb><c2><b2>`; otherwise, instances of `<e2><81><bb><c2><b2>`
# would get partially replaced by the replacement for `<c2><b2>`.
