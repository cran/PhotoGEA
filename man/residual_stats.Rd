\title{Calculate statistics that describe the residuals of a fit}

\description{
  Calculates several key statistics from the residuals of of a fit: the residual
  sum of squares (\code{RSS}), the mean squared error (\code{MSE}), the root
  mean squared error (\code{RMSE}), the residual standard error (\code{RSE}),
  and the Akaike information criterion (\code{AIC}). This function is used
  internally by all fitting functions in the \code{PhotoGEA} package, such as
  \code{\link{fit_ball_berry}} and \code{\link{fit_c3_aci}}.

\usage{
  residual_stats(fit_residuals, units, nparam)
}

\arguments{
  \item{fit_residuals}{
    A numeric vector representing the residuals from a fit, i.e., the
    differences between the measured and fitted values.
  }

  \item{units}{
    A string expressing the units of the residuals.
  }

  \item{nparam}{
    The number of free parameters that were varied when performing the fit.
  }
}

\details{
  This function calculates several model-independent measures of the quality of
  a fit. The basis for these statistics are the \code{residuals} (also known as
  the \code{errors}). If the measured values of a quantity \code{y} are given by
  \code{y_measured} and the fitted values are \code{y_fitted}, then the
  residuals are defined to be \code{residual = y_measured - y_fitted}. The key
  statistics that can be calculated from the residuals are as follows:
  \itemize{
    \item The residual sum of squares (\code{RSS}) is also known as the sum of
          squared errors (\code{SSE}). As its name implies, it is simply the sum
          of all the squared residuals: \code{RSS = sum(residuals^2)}.
    \item The mean squared error (\code{MSE}) is the mean value of the squared
          residuals: \code{MSE = sum(residuals^2) / n = RSS / n}, where \code{n}
          is the number of residuals.
    \item The root mean squared error (\code{RMSE}) is the square root of the
          mean squared error: \code{RMSE = sqrt(MSE) = sqrt(RSS / n)}.
    \item The residual standard error \code{RSE} is given by \code{RSE =
          sqrt(RSS / dof)}, where \code{dof = n - nparam} is the number of
          degrees of freedom involved in the fit.
    \item The Akaike information criterion \code{AIC} is given by \code{AIC =
          npts * (log(2 * pi) + 1) + npts * log(MSE) + 2 * (nparam + 1)}.
  }

  For a given model, the \code{RMSE} is usually a good way to compare the
  quality of different fits. When trying to decide which model best fits the
  measured data, the \code{AIC} may be a more appropriate metric since it
  controls for the number of parameters in the model.

  The AIC definition used here is appropriate for the results of maximum
  likelihood fitting with equal variance, or minimum least squares fitting. For
  more details about the AIC equation above and its relation to the more general
  definition of AIC, see Section 2 of Banks & Joyner (2017).
