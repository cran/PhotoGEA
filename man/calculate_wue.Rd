\title{Calculate intrinsic water use efficiency}

\description{
  Calculates the intrinsic water use efficiency (\code{iWUE}). This function can
  accomodate alternative column names for the variables taken from the data
  file in case they change at some point in the future. This function also
  checks the units of each required column and will produce an error if any
  units are incorrect.

\details{
  Leaf-level water use efficiency (\code{lWUE}) is defined as the ratio of net
  CO2 assimilation (\code{An}) to transpiration (\code{E}):

  \code{lWUE = An / E}.

  This quantity can also be expressed in terms of water and CO2 concentrations:

  \code{lWUE = 0.6 * Ca * (1 - Ci / Ca) / (H2Oi - H2Oa)}.

  Here, \code{Ca} and \code{Ci} are the atmospheric and intercellular CO2
  concentrations, and \code{H2Oa} and \code{H2Oi} are the atmospheric and
  intercellular water vapor concentrations. If differences in \code{lWUE} are
  measured between different groups of plants, it can be helpful to separately
  investigate \code{Ci / Ca} and \code{H2Oi - H2Oa} to see which factor is
  driving the differences.

  The intrinsic water use efficiency \code{iWUE} is a measure of leaf-level
  water use efficiency, and it is defined to be the ratio \code{An} and the
  stomatal conductance to H2O diffusion (\code{gsw}):

  \code{iWUE = An / gsw}.

  For C3 plants, \code{iWUE} can be reexpressed as

  \code{iWUE = (gmc / gsw) / (1 + (gmc / gsw)) * (Ca - Cc)},

  where \code{gmc} is the mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion and \code{Cc}
  is the chloroplast CO2 concentration. If differences in \code{iWUE} are
  measured between different groups of plants, it can be helpful to separately
  investigate \code{gmc / gsw} and \code{Ca - Cc} to see which factor is driving
  the differences.

  Note: both measures of water use efficiency depend directly or indirectly on
  stomatal conductance. Stomata are notoriously slow to reach steady-state, but
  water use efficiency is only reliable at steady-state. For this reason, it is
  recommended to only analyze water use efficiency for gas exchange measurements
  where stomatal conductance has stabilized. For an A-Ci or A-Q curve, only the
  first measured point has typically reached steady-state stomatal conductance.
  On the other hand, for a Ball-Berry curve, all measured points should have
  reached steady-state stomatal conductance.

  Efficiency as a Constraint and Target for Improving the Resilience and
  Productivity of C3 and C4 Crops." Annual Review of Plant Biology 70 (1):

  In this function, the following variables are calculated:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{lWUE}, given by \code{iWUE = An / E}
    \item \code{Cia_ratio}, given by \code{Cia_ratio = Ci / Ca}
    \item \code{drawdown_sw}, given by \code{drawdown_sw = H2Oi - H2Oa} (this
          is the drawdown of water vapor across the stomata)
    \item \code{iWUE}, given by \code{iWUE = An / gsw}
    \item \code{g_ratio}, given by \code{g_ratio = gmc / gsw}
    \item \code{drawdown_ct}, given by \code{drawdown_ct = Ca - Cc} (this is the
          total drawdown of CO2 from the ambient air to the chloroplast)
  }

  Note: \code{g_ratio} and \code{drawdown_ct} are only calculated if
  \code{calculate_c3} is \code{TRUE}.
