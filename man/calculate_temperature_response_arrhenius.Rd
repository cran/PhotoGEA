\title{Calculate temperature-dependent values using Arrhenius equations}

\description{
  Calculate leaf-temperature-dependent values of various parameters using
  Arrhenius equations. It is rare for users to call this function directly;
  instead, it is used internally by
  \code{\link{calculate_temperature_response}}.

    measurement system.

  \item{arrhenius_parameters}{
    A list of named lists. Each list element should describe the Arrhenius
    scaling factor (\code{c}), activation energy in \code{kJ / mol} (\code{Ea}),
    and units (\code{units}) for a variable that follows an Arrhenius
    temperature dependence. The name of each list element should be the

\details{
  The Arrhenius equation is often used to calculate the temperature dependence
  of the rate of a chemical reaction. It is often stated as follows:

  (1) \code{rate = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))}

  where \code{A} is the "pre-exponential factor" that sets the overall scaling,
  \code{Ea} is the activation energy, \code{R} is the ideal gas constant, and
  \code{T} is the temperature in Kelvin. See, for example, the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation}{Wikipedia page for the equation}.

  In photosynthesis research, it is common to use an alternative form of the
  equation, where the pre-exponential factor \code{A} is rewritten as an
  exponent \code{A = exp(c)}, where \code{c} is a "scaling factor" whose value
  can be calculated from \code{A} according to \code{c = ln(A)}). In this
  formulation, the equation becomes:

  (2) \code{rate = exp(c) * exp(-Ea / (R * T)) = exp(c - Ea / (R * T))}

  The advantage of this version is that the natural logarithm of the rate is
  equal to \code{c - Ea / (R * T)}. This means that the Arrhenius paramerer
  values can be easily determined from a linear fit of \code{log(rate)} against
  \code{1 / (R * T)}; \code{c} is the y-intercept and \code{-Ea} is the slope.

  In \code{calculate_temperature_response_arrhenius}, the scaling factor
  (\code{c}), activation energy (\code{Ea}), and units (\code{units}) for a
  variable must be specified as elements of a list, which itself is a named
  element of \code{arrhenius_parameters}. For example, if a variable called
  \code{Kc} has \code{c = 38.05}, \code{Ea = 79.43}, and units of
  \code{micromol mol^(-1)}, the \code{arrhenius_parameters} argument could be
  specified as follows:
  \code{list(Kc = list(c = 38.05, Ea = 79.43, units = 'micromol mol^(-1)'))}.

  It is rare to directly specify the Arrhenius parameters; instead, it is more
  typical to use one of the pre-set values such as those included in
  \code{\link{c3_temperature_param_sharkey}}.

  Sometimes a publication will specify the value of a variable at 25 degrees C
  instead of the Arrhenius scaling factor \code{c}. In this case, there is a
  "trick" for determining the value of \code{c}. For example, if the Arrhenius
  exponent should be \code{X} at 25 degrees C, then we have the following:
  \code{X = exp(c - Ea / (R * (25 + 273.15)))}, which we can solve algebraically
  for \code{c} as follows: \code{c = ln(X) + Ea / f}, where
  \code{f = R * (25 + 273.15)}. As a special case, for parameters normalized to
  1 at 25 degrees C, we have \code{c = Ea / f}. The value of \code{f} can be
  accessed as \code{PhotoGEA:::f}.

  Another common scenario is that we may wish to convert the units of a variable
  defined by Arrhenius exponents. For example, let's say \code{Y} is determined
  by an Arrhenius exponent, i.e., that \code{Y = exp(c - Ea / (R * T))}, and we
  want to convert \code{Y} to different units via a multiplicative conversion
  factor \code{cf}. Then, in the new units, \code{Y} becomes
  \code{Y_new = cf * Y = cf * exp(c - (R * T))}. Through algebra, it is possible
  to combine \code{cf} with the original value of \code{c} as
  \code{c_new = c + ln(cf)}. Then we can continue calculating \code{Y_new} using
  an Arrhenius factor as \code{Y_new = exp(c_new - Ea / (R * T))}.

\value{
  An \code{exdf} object based on \code{exdf_obj} that includes one new column
  for each element of \code{arrhenius_parameters}, where the
  temperature-dependent values of these new columns are determined using the
  temperature values specified by the \code{tleaf_column_name} column. The
  category of each of these new columns is
  \code{calculate_temperature_response_arrhenius} to indicate that they were
  created using this function.
