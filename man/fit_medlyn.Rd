\title{Fits the Medlyn model to an experimental curve}

\description{
  Fits measured values of stomatal conductance using the Medlyn model. This
  function can accomodate alternative column names for the variables taken from
  gas exchange log files in case they change at some point in the future. This
  function also checks the units of each required column and will produce an
  error if any units are incorrect.

\details{
  The Medlyn model is a simple way to describe the response of a leaf's stomata
  to its assimilation rate and local environmental consitions. Specifically, it
  predicts that the stomatal conductance to water vapor (\code{gsw}) using the
  following equation:

  \code{gsw = g0 + 1.6 * (1 + g1 / sqrt(VPDleaf)) * A / Csurface},

  where \code{VPDleaf} is the vapor pressure deficit at the leaf surface,
  \code{A} is the net CO2 assimilation rate, \code{Csurface} is the CO2
  concentration at the leaf surface, \code{g0} is the stomatal conductance when
  \code{A} is zero, and \code{g1} is a parameter describing the leaf's combined
  response to environmental parameters.

  Fits from this model are typically plotted with \code{gsw} on the Y-axis and
  \code{A / (Csurface * sqrt(VPDleaf))} on the X-axis. Because \code{g1} is
  typically close to or larger than 1, the model exhibits an almost linear
  response of \code{gsw} to \code{A / (Csurface * sqrt(VPDleaf))}, which we
  refer to as the "Medlyn index" in analogy with the Ball-Berry index (see
  \code{\link{calculate_ball_berry_index}}).

  Although this model is certainly an oversimplification, it does encode some
  important stomatal responses. For example, when humidity is low, the stomata
  close, reducing stomatal conductance. Likewise, if the CO2 concentration
  around the leaf is depleted, the stomata open to allow more CO2 to diffuse
  into the leaf's interior, increasing somatal conductance.

  The Medlyn model was originally described in Medlyn, B. E. et al. "Reconciling
  the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance."
  Global Change Biology 17, 2134â€“2144 (2011)
  [\doi{10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02375.x}].

  Medlyn parameters are typically determined using the same type of response
  curve measured for parameterizing the Ball-Berry model. See
  \code{\link{fit_ball_berry}} for more details.

  This function uses \code{\link[stats]{nls}} to perform the fit, beginning from
  an initial guess of \code{g0 = 0.005} and \code{g1 = 4}.

  This function assumes that \code{replicate_exdf} represents a single response
  curve. To fit multiple curves at once, this function is often used along with
  \code{\link{by.exdf}} and \code{\link{consolidate}}.

\value{
  A list with two elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{fits}: An \code{exdf} object including the measured values and
          the fitted values of stomatal conductance. The fitted values will be
          stored in a column whose name is determined by appending
          \code{'_fits'} to the end of \code{gsw_column_name}; typically, this
          will be \code{'gsw_fits'}. Also includes residuals in the
          \code{gsw_residuals} column and values of the Medlyn model parameters
          \code{medlyn_g0} and \code{medlyn_g1}.
    \item \code{parameters}: An \code{exdf} object including the fitting
          parameters and R-squared value. The Medlyn model parameters are stored
          in the \code{medlyn_g0} and \code{medlyn_g1} columns, their standard
          errors are stored in the \code{medlyn_g0_err} and \code{medlyn_g1_err}
          columns. Other statistical descriptors of the fit as calculated by
          \code{\link{residual_stats}} are also included.
