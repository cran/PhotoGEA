\title{Reorganize response curve data for analysis and plotting}

\description{
  Prepares a set of response curves for future processing and analysis by
  numbering and reordering the points, (optionally) removing recovery points,
  and (optionally) calculating average values of key variables across each
  curve.

\usage{
  organize_response_curve_data(
    licor_exdf,
    identifier_columns,
    measurement_numbers_to_remove,
    column_for_ordering,
    ordering_column_tolerance = Inf,
    columns_to_average = c(),
    print_information = TRUE
  )
}

\arguments{
  \item{licor_exdf}{
    An \code{exdf} object representing response curve data from a Licor gas
    exchange measurement system.
  }

  \item{identifier_columns}{
    A vector or list of strings representing the names of columns in
    \code{licor_exdf} that, taken together, uniquely identify each curve. This
    often includes names like \code{plot}, \code{event}, \code{replicate}, etc.
  }

  \item{measurement_numbers_to_remove}{
    A vector of integers specifying which points to remove from each curve; for
    example, if each curve has 16 points and the 10^th^ and 11^th^ points along
    the sequence should not be included in subsequent analysis,
    \code{measurement_numbers_to_remove} could be specified as \code{c(10, 11)}.
    If \code{measurement_numbers_to_remove} is set to \code{c()}, no points will
    be removed.
  }

  \item{column_for_ordering}{
    The name of a column that is systematically varied to produce each curve;
    for example, in a light response curve, this would typically by \code{Qin}.
  }

  \item{ordering_column_tolerance}{
    To be passed to \code{\link{check_response_curve_data}} as the
    \code{driving_column_tolerance} input argument.
  }

  \item{columns_to_average}{
    A list of columns whose average values should be calculated; see below for
    details.
  }

  \item{print_information}{
    To be passed to \code{\link{check_response_curve_data}}.
  }

\details{
  For an \code{exdf} object consisting of multiple response curves that can be
  identified using the values of its \code{identifier_columns}, this function
  performs the following actions:
  \itemize{
    \item Assigns a sequential number to each measurement in each curve,
          beginning with 1. In other words, the first point in the curve is
          given number 1, the second is given number 2, etc. These numbers are
          stored as a new column called \code{seq_num}.
    \item (Optionally) extracts a subset of the data. If
          \code{measurement_numbers_to_remove} is \code{c()}, then this step
          will be skipped; otherwise, values of \code{seq_num} specified by
          \code{measurement_numbers_to_remove} will be removed, and then
          \code{check_response_curve_data} will be called to make sure the
          remaining points all follow the same sequence of setpoint values
          (within the tolerance set by \code{ordering_column_tolerance}),
          treating the \code{column_for_ordering} as the \code{driving_column}.
    \item Reorders the data according to ascending values of the
          \code{column_for_ordering}.
    \item (Optionally) calculates average values of important columns. If
          \code{columns_to_average} is \code{c()}, then this step will be
          skipped; otherwise, for each curve, the mean value of each column
          specified in \code{columns_to_average} will be stored in a new column
          whose name is based on the original column name, but with
          \code{'_avg'} added at the end. For example, the average value of the
          \code{Qin} column would be stored in \code{Qin_avg}.
  }

  Removing certain points is often helpful for A-Ci curves, where the CO~2~
  concentration begins at the ambient value, is decreased to a low value, is
  reset to atmospheric for several measurements to allow the plant to
  reacclimate, and then is increased to higher values. In this case, only the
  first measurement at ambient CO~2~ is used for plotting or additional
  analysis, and the "recovery" points should be removed.

  Reordering the points is often helpful for plotting. For example, the points
  in an A-Ci curve would not be ordered according to their Ci values in a curve
  measured using a sequence as described above. This can cause issues when
  making line plots, so it may be convenient to reorder them according to their
  Ci values.

  Calculating average values of certain columns is especially useful for
  estimating \code{Jmax} values using \code{\link{calculate_jmax}}, since this
  operation requires average values of leaf temperature and incident photon flux
  across each curve.

# Read an example Licor file included in the PhotoGEA package and organize it.
# This file includes several 7-point light-response curves that can be uniquely
# identified by the values of its 'species' and 'plot' columns. Since these are
# light-response curves, each one follows a pre-set sequence of `Qin` values.

# Split the data into individual curves, keep all seven measurement points in
# each curve, and order them by their incident light values (since these are
# light response curves). The curves were measured from high to low values of
# `Qin`, so after organizing the curves, their order will be reversed from the
# original version. Also add the average value of TleafCnd and Qin for each
# curve.
