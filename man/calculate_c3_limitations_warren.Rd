\title{Estimate the relative limiting factors to C3 photosynthesis}

\description{
  Uses the method from Warren et al. (2003) to estimate the relative limitations
  to C3 photosynthesis due to stomatal conductance and mesophyll conductance.
  This function can accomodate alternative column names for the variables taken
  from the data file in case they change at some point in the future. This
  function also checks the units of each required column and will produce an
  error if any units are incorrect.

\details{
  When analyzing or interpreting C3 gas exchange data, it is often useful to
  estimate the relative limitations to assimilation that are due to stomatal
  conductance or mesophyll conductance. This can be done using a framework first
  introduced by Warren et al. (2003). In this framework, the relative limitation
  due to stomatal conductance (\code{ls}) is

  \code{ls = (An_inf_gsc - A_modeled) / An_inf_gsc}

  and the relative limitation due to mesophyll conductance (\code{lm}) is

  \code{lm = (An_inf_gmc - A_modeled) / An_inf_gmc}. These are equations 10 and
  11 in Warren et al. (2003).

  In these equations \code{A_modeled} is the net assimilation rate calculated
  using the Farquhar-von-Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model at the measured value of
  the chloroplast CO2 concentration (\code{Cc}). The other two assimilation
  rates (\code{An_inf_gsc} and \code{An_inf_gmc}) are also calculated using the
  FvCB model, but under different assumptions: \code{An_inf_gsc} assumes that
  stomatal conductance is infinite while mesophyll conductance is as measured,
  while \code{An_inf_gmc} assumes that mesophyll conductance is infinite while
  stomatal conductance is as measured.

  In other words, \code{ls} expresses the observed assimilation rate as a
  fractional decrease relative to a hypothetical plant with infinite stomatal
  conductance, while \code{lm} expresses the observed assimilation rate as a
  fractional decrease relative to a hypothetical plant with infinite mesophyll
  conductance.

  For example, if \code{lm = 0.4}, this means that the observed assimilation
  rate is 40 percet lower than a hypothetical plant with infinite mesophyll
  conductance. If mesophyll conductance were to increase (all else remaining
  the same), then \code{lm} would decrease. This is not the case with other
  estimations of limiting factors, such as the one used in
  \code{\link{calculate_c3_limitations_grassi}}. (See Leverett & Kromdijk for
  more details.)

  To actually calculate \code{An_inf_gsc} and \code{An_inf_gmc}, it is first
  necessary to estimate the corresponding values of \code{Cc} that would occur
  with infinite stomatal or mesophyll conductance. This can be done with a 1D
  diffusion equation expressed using drawdown values:

  \code{Cc = Ca - drawdown_cs - drawdown_cm},

  where \code{drawdown_cs = Ca - Ci} is the drawdown of CO2 across the stomata
  (assuming infinite boundary layer conductance) and
  \code{drawdown_cm = Ci - Cc} is the drawdown of CO2 across the mesophyll. If
  one conductance is infinite, the corresponding drawdown becomes zero. Thus, we
  have:

  \code{Cc_inf_gsc = Ca - 0 - (Ci - Cc) = Ca - Ci + Cc}

  and

  \code{Cc_inf_gmc = Ca - (Ca - Ci) - 0 = Ci},

  where \code{Cc_inf_gsc} is the value of \code{Cc} that would occur with
  infinite stomatal conductance and the measured mesophyll conductance, and
  \code{Cc_inf_gmc} is the value of \code{Cc} that would occur with infinite
  mesophyll conductance and the measured stomatal conductance.

  Once values of \code{Cc}, \code{Cc_inf_gsc}, and \code{Cc_inf_gmc}, the
  corresponding assimilation rates are calculated using
  \code{\link{calculate_c3_assimilation}}, and then the limitation factors are
  calculated as described above.
