\title{Calculate RL and Ci_star using the Laisk method}

\description{
  Uses the Laisk method to estimate \code{Ci_star} and \code{RL}. This function
  can accomodate alternative colum names for the variables taken from log files
  in case they change at some point in the future. This function also checks the
  units of each required column and will produce an error if any units are
  incorrect.

\details{
  The Laisk method is a way to estimate \code{RL} and \code{Ci_star} for a C3
  plant. Definitions of these quantities and a description of the theory
  underpinning this method is given below.

  For a C3 plant, the net CO2 assimilation rate \code{An} is given by

  \code{An = Vc - Rp - RL},

  where \code{Vc} is the rate of RuBP carboxylation, \code{Rp} is the rate of
  carbon loss due to photorespiration, and \code{RL} is the rate of carbon loss
  due to non-photorespiratory respiration (also known as the rate of day
  respiration, the rate of mitochondrial respiration, or the rate of respiration
  in the light). Because RuBP carboxylation and photorespiration both occur due
  to Rubisco activity, these rates are actually proportional to each other:

  \code{Rp = Vc * Gamma_star / Cc},

  where \code{Cc} is the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast (where Rubisco is
  located) and \code{Gamma_star} will be discussed below. Using this expression,
  the net CO2 assimilation rate can be written as

  \code{An = Vc * (1 - Gamma_star / Cc) - RL}.

  When \code{Cc} is equal to \code{Gamma_star}, the net assimilation rate is
  equal to \code{-RL}. For this reason, \code{Gamma_star} is usually referred to
  as the CO2 compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration.

  In general, \code{Cc} is related to the intercellular CO2 concentration
  \code{Ci} according to

  \code{Ci = Cc + An / gmc},

  where \code{gmc} is the mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion. When \code{Cc}
  is equal to \code{Gamma_star}, we therefore have
  \code{Ci = Gamma_star - RL / gmc}. This special value of \code{Ci} is referred
  to as \code{Ci_star}, and can be understood as the value of \code{Ci} where
  \code{Cc = Gamma_star} and \code{An = -RL}. Note that the values of
  \code{Gamma_star} and \code{Ci_star} depend on Rubisco properties, mesophyll
  conductance, and the ambient O2 concentration, but not on the incident light
  intensity.

  These observations suggest a method for estimating \code{RL} from a leaf:
  Measure \code{An} vs. \code{Ci} curves at several light intensities, and find
  the value of \code{Ci} where the curves intersect with each other. This will
  be \code{Ci_star}, and the corresponding value of \code{An} will be equal to
  \code{-RL}.

  In practice, it is unlikely that the measured curves will all exactly
  intersect at a single point. A method for dealing with this issue was
  developed in Walker & Ort (2015) and described in more detail in Busch et al.
  (2024). Briefly, a linear fit is first made to each A-Ci curve, enabling the
  calculation of an intercept-slope curve. Then another linear fit is made to
  the intercept-slope curve. The intercept of this fit is equal to \code{-RL}
  and its slope is equal to \code{-Ci_star}.

  Note: it is possible that \code{RL} depends on incident light intensity, an
  issue which complicates the application of the Laisk method. See the
  references for more details.

  This function returns a list with the following named elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{first_fit_parameters}: An \code{exdf} object with the slope (and
          its standard error), intercept (and its standard error), R-squared
          value, and p-value for each linear fit of A vs. Ci. These are included
          as the \code{laisk_slope}, \code{laisk_slope_err},
          \code{laisk_intercept}, \code{laisk_intercept_err}, \code{r_squared},

    \item \code{first_fits}: An \code{exdf} object based on
          \code{replicate_exdf} that also includes the fitted values of
          \code{An} in a new column whose name is \code{a_column_name} followed
          by \code{_fit} (for example, \code{A_fit}). The fits are extrapolated
          to \code{Ci = 0} so they can be visually checked for a common

          (and its standard error), \code{Ci_Star} (and its standard error) as
          estimated from a linear fit of \code{laisk_intercept} vs.
          \code{laisk_slope}. Also includes the R-squared and p-value of the
          fit.
    \item \code{second_fit_parameters}: An \code{exdf} object based on
          \code{first_fit_parameters} that also includes fitted values of
          \code{laisk_intercept} in the \code{laisk_intercept_fit} column.
