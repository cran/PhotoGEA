\details{
  The CO2 compensation point in the absence of non-photorespiratory CO2 release
  (\code{Gamma_star}) is the partial pressure of CO2 in the chloroplast at which
  CO2 gains from Rubisco carboxylation are exactly balanced by CO2 losses from
  Rubisco oxygenation; this quantity plays a key role in many photosynthesis
  calculations. One way to calculate its value is to use its definition, which
  can be found in many places, such as Equation 2.17 from von Caemmerer (2000):

  \code{Gamma_star = alpha_pr * O / S},

  where \code{O} is the partial pressure (or mole fraction) of oxygen in the
  chloroplast, \code{S} is the Rubisco specificity on a gas basis, and
  \code{alpha_pr} is the number of CO2 molecules released by the
  photorespiratory cycle following each RuBP oxygenation (usually assumed to be
  0.5).

  The Rubisco specificity is often measured from an aqueous solution where the
  concentrations of O2 and CO2 are specified as molarities (moles of dissolved
  CO2 or O2 per mole of H2O). In this context, the equation above becomes

  \code{Gamma_star_aq = alpha_pr * O_aq / S_aq},

  where \code{Gamma_star_aq} and \code{O_aq} are the molarities of CO2 and O2
  corresponding to \code{Gamma_star} and \code{O} under the measurement
  conditions and \code{S_aq} is the specificity on a molarity basis.

  Henry's law can be used to relate these two versions of the equation; Henry's
  law states that the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the
  partial pressure of that gas outside the solution. The proportionality factor
  \code{H} is called Henry's constant (or sometimes the solubility), and its
  value depends on the temperature, gas species, and other factors. Using
  Henry's law, we can write \code{Gamma_star_aq = Gamma_star_aq * H_CO2} and
  \code{O = O_aq * H_O2}, where \code{H_CO2} is Henry's constant for CO2
  dissolved in H2O and \code{H_O2} is Henry's constant for O2 dissolved in H2O.
  With these replacements, we can re-express the equation above as:

  \code{Gamma_star / H_CO2 = alpha_pr * (O / H_O2) / S_aq}

  Solving for \code{Gamma_star}, we see that:

  \code{Gamma_star = (alpha_pr * O / S_aq) * (H_CO2 / H_O2)}.

  In other words, both the Rubisco specificity (as measured on a molarity basis)
  and the ratio of the two Henry's constants (\code{H_CO2 / H_O2}) play a role
  in determining \code{Gamma_star}. This equation also shows that it is possible
  to relate \code{S} (the specificity on a gas concentration basis) and
  \code{S_aq} as \code{S = S_aq * H_O2 / H_CO2}.

  The values of \code{H_O2} and \code{H_CO2} can be calculated from the
  temperature using Equation 18 from Tromans (1998) and Equation 4 from Carroll
  et al. (1991), respectively.

  In \code{calculate_gamma_star}, it is assumed that the value of specificity
  \code{S_aq} was was measured or otherwise determined at the leaf temperature;
  the leaf temperature is only used to determine the values of the two Henry's
  constants. Sometimes it is necessary to calculate the temperature-dependent
  value of the specificity using an Arrhenius equation; this can be accomplished
  via the \code{\link{calculate_temperature_response_arrhenius}} function from
  PhotoGEA.

  Finally, it is important to note that \code{Gamma_star} can also be directly
  calculated using an Arrhenius equation, rather than using the oxygen
  concentration and the specificity. The best approach for determining a value
  of \code{Gamma_star} in any particular situation will generally depend on the
  available information and the measurement conditions.

\value{
  An \code{exdf} object based on \code{exdf_obj} that includes the following
  additional columns, calculated as described above: \code{Gamma_star_tl} (the
  value of \code{Gamma_star} at the leaf temperature), \code{H_CO2},
  \code{H_O2}, and \code{specificity_gas_basis}. There are many choices for
  expressing Henry's constant values; here we express them as molalities per
  unit of pressure: \code{(mol solute / kg H2O) / Pa}. The category for each of
  these new columns is \code{calculate_gamma_star} to indicate that they were
  created using this function.
