\title{Exclude outliers from a data set}

\description{
  Excludes outliers from a data set using the "1.5 interquartile range" rule.
}

\usage{
  exclude_outliers(x, col_for_analysis, INDICES, method = 'exclude')

  \method{exclude_outliers}{data.frame}(x, col_for_analysis, INDICES, method = 'exclude')

  \method{exclude_outliers}{exdf}(x, col_for_analysis, INDICES, method = 'exclude')
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A data table}

  \item{col_for_analysis}{
    The name of a column of \code{x} that should be used to determine outliers.
  }

  \item{INDICES}{
    A factor or list of factors that each \code{nrow(x)} elements.
  }

  \item{method}{
    Specify whether to remove rows from \code{x} (\code{'remove'}) or to replace
    outlier values of \code{col_for_analysis} with \code{NA} (\code{'exclude'}).
  }
}

\value{
  This function returns an object formed from \code{x}, where the results
  depend on on the value of \code{method}.

  When \code{method} is \code{'remove'}, the returned object is a modified copy
  of \code{x} where all rows in which the value of \code{col_for_analysis} is an
  outlier have been removed.

  When \code{method} is \code{'exclude'}, the returned object is a modified copy
  of \code{x} where all outlier values of \code{col_for_analysis} have been
  replaced with \code{NA}.
}

\details{
  \code{exclude_outliers} is generic, with methods defined for data frames and
  \code{exdf} objects. This function uses a simple rule to detect outliers,
  where any point that deviates from the mean by more than \code{1.5 * IQR},
  where \code{IQR} is the interquartile range, is said to be an outlier. This
  method is also sometimes referred to as "Tukey's Fences," as seen in the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier}{Wikipedia page about outliers}.

  For data sets with extreme outliers, it may be necessary to exclude outliers
  more than once to actually remove them all.

# Read a Licor file included with the PhotoGEA package; this file includes
# several light response curves that can be identified by the 'species' and

# Remove points from each response curve in the data where the leaf temperature
# is determined to be an outlier
