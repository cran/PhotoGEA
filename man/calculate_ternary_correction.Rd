\details{
  During photosynthetic gas exchange, there are separate fluxes of CO2 and H2O
  flowing in and out of the leaf. These gases interact with each other and with
  air, forming a ternary mixture. These interactions must be taken into account
  when modeling carbon isotope discrimination. Typically this is done via
  \code{t}, a ternary correction factor first introduced by Farquhar and
  Cernusak (2012). Here we calculate \code{t} as described in Equations 9 and 10
  from Ubierna et al. (2018):

  \code{t = alpha_ac * E / (2 * g_ac)}

  and

  \code{a_bar = (a_b * (C_a - C_s) + a_s * (C_s - C_i)) / (C_a - C_i)},

  where \code{E} is the transpiration rate, \code{g_ac} is the total conductance
  to CO2 diffusion across the boundary layer and stomata in series, \code{a_bar}
  is the weighted fractionation across the boundary layer and stomata in series,
  \code{a_b} is the fractionation during diffusion through the boundary layer,
  \code{a_s} is the fractionation during diffusion through the stomata,
  \code{C_a} is the ambient CO2 concentration (in wet air), \code{C_s} is the
  CO2 concentration (in wet air) at the leaf surface, and \code{C_i} is the CO2
  concentration (in wet air) in the intercellular spaces.

  \code{alpha_ac} is the overall fractionation during diffusion through air;
  \code{alpha_ac} and \code{a_bar} are related according to an un-numbered
  equation in Ubierna et al. (2018) that appears just after Equation 9:

  \code{alpha_ac = 1 + a_bar}
