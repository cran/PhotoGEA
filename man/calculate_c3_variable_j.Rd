\title{Calculate C3 variable J}

\description{
  Calculates values of mesophyll conductance and chloroplast CO2 concentration
  using the "variable J" equation, as originally described in Harley et al.
  (1992) and modified in Moualeu-Ngangue, Chen, & Stutzel (2016). This function
  can accomodate alternative colum names for the variables taken from Licor
  files in case they change at some point in the future. This function also
  checks the units of each required column and will produce an error if any
  units are incorrect.

\details{
  The "Variable J" method is a way to estimate the chloroplast CO2 concentration
  \code{Cc} and the mesophyll conductance to CO2 \code{gmc} from combined gas
  exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, and was originally
  described in Harley et al. (1992). The main idea is that along with \code{Cc},
  the net CO2 assimilation rate (\code{An}), day respiration rate (\code{RL}),
  and CO2 compensation point in the absence of day respiration
  (\code{Gamma_star}) determine the actual RuBP regeneration rate
  (\code{J_actual}) required to support the Calvin-Benson cycle:

  \code{J_actual = (A + RL) * (4 * Cc + 8 * Gamma_star) / (Cc - Gamma_star)}

  This is Equation 6 in Harley et al. (1992). (Note: this equation can be
  derived by solving the equation for \code{Aj} from the FvCB model for
  \code{J}. However, this relationship holds true even when CO2 assimilation is
  not limited by RuBP regeneration. Hence, we distinguish between the actual
  regeneration rate \code{J_actual} and the maximum regeneration rate for a
  given incident light level \code{J}.)

  This equation can be rewritten by using a 1D diffusion equation to replace
  \code{Cc} with \code{Cc = Ci - An / gmc} and then solving for the mesophyll
  conductance. The result is Equation 7 in Harley et al. (1992), which we do not
  reproduce here. The importance of Equation 7 is that it calculates \code{gmc}
  from several quantities that can be measured using gas exchange (\code{Ci},
  \code{An}, and \code{RL}), a quantity whose values can be known beforehand
  (\code{Gamma_star}), and \code{J_actual} (which can be estimated from
  chlorophyll fluorescence measurements). Here we update Equation 7 to include
  \code{alpha_g} and \code{alpha_s} following Busch et al. (2018) (also see
  \code{\link{calculate_c3_assimilation}}.)

  The actual RuBP regeneration rate is related to the incident
  photosynthetically active flux density \code{Qin} and the operating efficiency
  of photosystem II \code{PhiPSII} according to:

  \code{J_actual = alpha_g * beta * Qin * PhiPSII},

  where \code{alpha_g} is the leaf absorptance and \code{beta} is the fraction of
  absorbed light energy directed to photosystem II. \code{Qin} is set by the
  measurement conditions, while \code{PhiPSII} can be estimated from chlorophyll
  fluorescence. However, the values of \code{alpha_g} and \code{beta} are
  generally unknown; \code{beta} in particular is difficult or impossible to
  measure and is often assumed to be 0.5. Thus, while Equation 7 from Harley et
  al. (1992) can be used to estimate \code{gmc}, there is a practical
  uncertainty associated with determining a value of \code{J_actual} to be used
  in Equation 7.

  Moualeu-Ngangue, Chen, & Stutzel (2016) developed a way to address this issue.
  The method from that paper replaces the product of \code{alpha_g} and
  \code{beta} by a single new parameter \code{tau}, and uses it to estimate the
  actual RuBP regeneration from fluoresence (\code{J_F}):

  \code{J_F = tau * Qin * PhiPSII}.

  This new parameter \code{tau} is assumed to be constant across an A-Ci curve,
  and is treated as an unknown whose value will be determined during a fitting
  procedure.

  In this function, the supplied values of \code{Qin}, \code{PhiPSII}, and
  \code{tau} are used to calculate values of \code{J_F}. Then, the values of
  \code{J_F} are used along with Equation 7 from Harley et al. (1992) to
  calculate \code{gmc}. Finally, a 1D diffusion equation is used to calculate
  \code{Cc}.

  \strong{Hard constraints:}

  Most input parameters to the Variable J equations have hard constraints on
  their values which are set by their biochemical or physical interpretation;
  for example, \code{RL} cannot be negative and \code{tau} must lie between 0
  and 1. Yet, because of measurement noise, sometimes it is necessary to use
  values outside these ranges when fitting an A-Ci curve with
  \code{\link{fit_c3_variable_j}}. To accomodate different potential use cases,
  it is possible to selectively apply these hard constraints by specifying
  different values of the \code{hard_constraints} input argument:

  \itemize{
    \item \code{hard_constraints = 0}: Constraints are only placed on inputs
          that are user-supplied and cannot be fit, such as \code{Qin}.

    \item \code{hard_constraints = 1}: Includes the same constraints as when
          \code{hard_constraints} is 0, with the additional constraint that
          all \code{Ci} values must be non-negative.

    \item \code{hard_constraints = 2}: Includes the same constraints as when
          \code{hard_constraints} is 1, which additional constraints on the
          parameters that can be fitted. For example, \code{RL_at_25} must be
          non-negative and \code{tau} must lie between 0 and 1.
  }

  If any input values violate any of the specified constraints, an error message
  will be thrown.
